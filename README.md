# Timestamp-Microservice

This microservice accepts a string and determines whether it is a unix
timestamp or a natural language date. If the string is either of these then
a unix timestamp and a natural language date are returned. If neither of 
these is sent then null is returned for both properties.

The working file for this project is <a href="https://github.com/Kavinci/Timestamp-Microservice/blob/master/timestamp.js">timestamp.js</a>. This project also uses
node.js and express.js as stated in the basecamp challenge from Free Code Camp:
